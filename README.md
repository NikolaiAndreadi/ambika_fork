# Ambika
## A hybrid MIDI polysynth and voicecard host.

Ambika consists of a compact motherboard serving as a "host" for up to 6 sound synthesis voicecard. While this design is primarily intended to be a flexible hybrid polysynth, it could also be used as a drum module/drum machine.

The motherboard comprises 6 audio outputs, each one connected to a voicecard ; a global mono output ; a pair of MIDI input/output ; a SD card slot ; a 5V/8V/-8V power supply capable of delivering 150mA on the 8V rails and 350mA on the 5V rail ; the master MCU and the user interface elements. The voicecards (a pair of each being attached to the 3 voicecard ports) are SPI slaves, they receive note and modulation data from the motherboard ; and output monophonic audio, ideally 1V pp.

3 designs of voicecards implementing a refined version of the Shruthi-1 engine are provided. Each of those use a different filter (4-Pole with LM13700, 4-Pole with SSM2164, 2-Pole SVF with SSM2164).

# Build

You'll need:
- make
- gcc-avr
- avr-libc
- avrdude
- python

On Ubuntu:
```
    sudo apt-get install gcc-avr make avr-libc
```

Next, you'll need to grab the projects this repo depends on.
```
    git submodule update --init
```

Once you've got that all settled, you'll need to change the path to `avr-gcc` in avrlib/makefile.mk
to match the path on your system.

```
    export AVRPATH=`which avr-gcc`
    sed "s|AVRLIB_TOOLS_PATH ?=.*|AVRLIB_TOOLS_PATH \?= `dirname $AVRPATH`/|" avrlib/makefile.mk > mkfiletmp
    mv mkfiletmp avrlib/makefile.mk
```

Then, for voice card `elf` files:

```
    make all
```

And for voice card `bin` files:
```
    make bin
```

For motherboard `elf` files:
```
    make bootstrap_controller
```

For motherboard `bin` files:
```
    make -f controller/makefile bin
```
